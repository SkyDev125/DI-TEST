# DI-TEST
 Test made to apply for devops

As a not so much experienced person ive been using a lot of my time to put into this test, at how much this all means to me.

Ive run throught some problems, and even by just making this test ive learned a lot of things and re-learned what i have in the past aswell. This was afterall an amazing experience.

I felt lost many times, but ended up at least achieving what was prettended at the 2nd aproach, but still going to look forward to do the first aproach and do the react app.

DevOps would be incredible for me to always have something to do, and not be sitting on stone, forgetting how to programm and not doing anything useless. At least i could be helping other people, learning a lot, expanding my horizons and contributing for DI itself a community that i give most of the time of my life for nowadays.

Afterall Im happy at how this went, and of course the site is not the best, and ive always look into making it get even prettier with the time. I tried to make it DI-ISH style, and i think i quite got the style of DI, even though still applying a personal mark of myself.

Thx for this oportunity of learning and this challenge of things that i have not done in past. IT took me many hours, but after learning it, now everything is easier!
